    <b>Why only two levels?</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Two levels are generally enough for all statementss, three levels would
    lead to poorly structured documents. statements module is designed for
    creation of short multipage study materials. It is usually better to
    use PDF format for longer documents. The easiest way to create PDFs are
    virtual printers (see

    <b>Can students edit statementss?</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Only teachers can create and edit statementss. There are no plans to
    implement student editing for statementss, but somebody may create something
    similar for students (Portfolio?). The main reason is to keep statements
    module as simple as possible.

    <b>How do I search the statementss?</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    At present there is only one way, use browser's search capability
    in print page. Global searching is now possible only in Moodle forums.
    It would be nice to have global searching for all resources including
    statementss, any volunteers?

  <dd>
    Either rephrase your titles or ask your site admin to change TOC
    width. It is defined globally for all statementss in module configuration
    page.
